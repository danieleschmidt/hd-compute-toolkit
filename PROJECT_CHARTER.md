# HD-Compute-Toolkit Project Charter

**Project Name**: HD-Compute-Toolkit  
**Charter Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Charter Owner**: Daniel Schmidt  

## Project Vision

Create the definitive open-source library for hyperdimensional computing that enables researchers and practitioners to harness the power of high-dimensional vector spaces for cognitive computing, pattern recognition, and neuromorphic applications across diverse hardware platforms.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Fragmented Ecosystem**: Existing HDC implementations are scattered across research labs with inconsistent APIs and limited hardware support
2. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Most implementations lack optimization for modern GPU/TPU architectures, limiting scalability
3. **Framework Lock-in**: Researchers are forced to choose between PyTorch or JAX, preventing collaboration and code reuse  
4. **Hardware Barriers**: No unified interface for FPGA acceleration, limiting adoption in high-performance applications
5. **Reproducibility Crisis**: Lack of standardized benchmarks makes it difficult to compare research results

### Business Impact
- **Research Efficiency**: 6+ months saved per HDC research project through unified tooling
- **Performance Gains**: 10-100x speedup potential through hardware optimization
- **Market Opportunity**: Growing neuromorphic computing market ($1.2B by 2027)
- **Academic Impact**: Enable reproducible HDC research across institutions

## Project Scope
