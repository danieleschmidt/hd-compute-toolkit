# HD-Compute-Toolkit Project Charter

## Project Vision

Create the definitive open-source library for hyperdimensional computing, enabling researchers and practitioners to leverage high-dimensional representations for cognitive computing, pattern recognition, and neuromorphic applications with unprecedented performance and ease of use.

## Problem Statement

Current hyperdimensional computing research suffers from:
- **Fragmented implementations**: No unified, high-performance library
- **Performance barriers**: Inefficient implementations limit scalability
- **Hardware underutilization**: Lack of FPGA/TPU acceleration
- **Reproducibility challenges**: Inconsistent baselines across research groups

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- High-performance HDC operations for PyTorch and JAX
- Binary hypervector support (10,000-32,000 dimensions)
- Hardware acceleration (FPGA, Vulkan, CUDA, TPU)
- Reproducible benchmarks from Qualcomm 2025 speech command demo
- Memory structures (item memory, associative memory)
- Cognitive computing and neuromorphic application examples

### Out of Scope
- Non-binary hypervector representations (future consideration)
- Domain-specific applications beyond speech/cognitive examples
- Real-time embedded deployment (edge computing future scope)
- Distributed training across multiple machines (v1.0+ feature)

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
- **Performance**: 10x faster than existing implementations
- **Accuracy**: Match or exceed Qualcomm 2025 baselines
- **Scale**: Support 32,000-dimensional operations efficiently

- **Research Impact**: 5+ research papers citing toolkit by end of 2025
- **Contributors**: 10+ external contributors to codebase
- **Integration**: Used in 3+ academic research groups

### Business Success Metrics
- **Documentation**: Complete API docs and tutorials
- **Reliability**: <1% bug rate in production usage
- **Compatibility**: Support Python 3.8-3.11, PyTorch 1.12+, JAX 0.3+
- **Maintenance**: Sustainable development with automated CI/CD

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Research Community**: HDC researchers and cognitive computing scientists
