## Versioning Strategy

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for version numbers:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner  
- **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

### Pre-release Versions
- **Alpha** (`X.Y.Z-alpha.N`): Internal testing, may have breaking changes
- **Beta** (`X.Y.Z-beta.N`): Feature complete, API stable, testing phase
- **Release Candidate** (`X.Y.Z-rc.N`): Production ready, final validation

### Version Support Policy
- **Current major version**: Full support with new features and bug fixes
- **Previous major version**: Critical bug fixes and security updates for 12 months
- **Older versions**: Security updates only for 6 months after deprecation

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from 0.x to 1.0
- Breaking changes and migration steps will be documented here
- Automated migration tools and scripts when available
- Compatibility layer information and deprecation timeline

### Hardware Backend Changes
- GPU/FPGA kernel compatibility updates
- Performance tuning recommendations for new backends
- Driver and dependency requirement changes
