# ADR-001: Framework Agnostic Design Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Core Development Team  
**Tags**: architecture, frameworks, abstraction

## Context

HD-Compute-Toolkit needs to support multiple ML frameworks (PyTorch, JAX) while maintaining code reuse and consistent APIs. Different research groups and deployment environments prefer different frameworks, and hardware acceleration requirements vary significantly.

## Decision

Implement a framework-agnostic architecture with abstract base classes in `hd_compute.core` and concrete implementations in framework-specific modules (`hd_compute.torch`, `hd_compute.jax`).

## Rationale

- **Flexibility**: Users can choose their preferred framework without API changes
- **Hardware Optimization**: Each framework provides different hardware acceleration paths
- **Code Reuse**: Common algorithms and utilities shared across implementations  
- **Testing**: Framework-agnostic tests ensure consistent behavior
- **Future Proofing**: Easy to add new frameworks (TensorFlow, MLX) without architectural changes

Alternative considered: Single framework approach - rejected due to limited hardware support and user preference constraints.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Broader user adoption across research communities
- Optimal performance on different hardware (GPU/TPU/FPGA)
- Reduced vendor lock-in
- Consistent API regardless of backend choice

### Negative
- Increased complexity in maintaining multiple implementations
- Potential for behavioral inconsistencies between frameworks
- Additional testing overhead

### Neutral
- Abstract base classes add slight performance overhead
- Documentation must cover multiple usage patterns

## Implementation Notes

- Core operations defined in `HDComputeBase` abstract class
- Each framework implementation inherits and implements abstract methods
- Common utilities in `hd_compute.core.utils` module
- Factory pattern for backend selection based on user preference
