# ADR-001: Framework Selection for HDC Backend Implementation

Date: 2025-08-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

HD-Compute-Toolkit requires efficient numerical computing backends for hyperdimensional computing operations. The choice of framework affects performance, hardware acceleration capabilities, ecosystem integration, and developer experience. Key requirements include:

- Support for high-dimensional binary vector operations
- GPU/TPU acceleration capabilities
- Efficient memory management for large hypervectors
- Strong ecosystem for research and production deployment

## Decision

We will implement dual backends using PyTorch and JAX:

1. **PyTorch Backend**: Primary backend for research and development
   - Mature CUDA ecosystem for GPU acceleration
   - Extensive community and documentation
   - Strong integration with existing ML workflows

2. **JAX Backend**: Secondary backend for TPU acceleration and performance
   - Superior TPU support through XLA compilation
   - Functional programming paradigm suitable for HDC operations
   - Advanced optimization capabilities

Both backends will implement a common abstract interface defined in `hd_compute.core`.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Performance flexibility**: Choose optimal backend per use case
- **Hardware coverage**: PyTorch for GPUs, JAX for TPUs
- **Ecosystem integration**: Compatible with both PyTorch and JAX workflows
- **Future-proofing**: Not locked into single framework evolution

### Negative Consequences

- **Maintenance overhead**: Two implementations to maintain
- **API complexity**: Abstract interface must accommodate both frameworks
- **Testing burden**: Double test coverage requirements
- **Binary size**: Larger distribution due to dual dependencies

### Neutral Consequences

- **Learning curve**: Developers need familiarity with both frameworks
- **Documentation**: API docs must cover both backends

## Alternatives Considered

### Single PyTorch Backend
- **Pros**: Simpler maintenance, mature ecosystem
- **Cons**: Limited TPU support, less optimization flexibility

### Single JAX Backend
- **Pros**: Superior compilation and optimization
- **Cons**: Smaller community, less mature GPU ecosystem

### NumPy Only
- **Pros**: Minimal dependencies, universal compatibility
- **Cons**: No hardware acceleration, poor performance

### TensorFlow
- **Pros**: Good TPU support, enterprise adoption
- **Cons**: Complex API, declining research popularity

## Implementation Notes

1. **Phase 1**: Implement PyTorch backend with core operations
2. **Phase 2**: Add JAX backend with feature parity
3. **Phase 3**: Benchmark and optimize both implementations
4. **Migration**: Abstract interface allows backend switching without user code changes

Timeline: Complete dual backend implementation by v0.2.0
