# Architecture Overview

HD-Compute-Toolkit is designed as a modular, high-performance library for hyperdimensional computing with multiple backend support.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Framework Agnostic**: Abstract base classes allow PyTorch and JAX implementations
2. **Hardware Acceleration**: Pluggable kernel system for FPGA/Vulkan acceleration  
3. **Scalability**: Optimized for 10K-32K dimensional binary hypervectors
4. **Extensibility**: Modular design for easy addition of new operations and backends

## Module Architecture

### Core Module (`hd_compute.core`)
- Abstract base classes defining HDC operations
- Framework-independent interfaces
- Common utilities and data structures

### Backend Implementations
- **PyTorch** (`hd_compute.torch`): GPU-accelerated operations with CUDA kernels
- **JAX** (`hd_compute.jax`): TPU-optimized implementations with XLA compilation

### Hardware Acceleration (`hd_compute.kernels`)
- **FPGA**: Verilog/HLS implementations for maximum throughput
- **Vulkan**: Compute shaders for cross-platform GPU acceleration

### Memory Structures (`hd_compute.memory`)
- Item memory for encoding discrete symbols
- Associative memory for similarity-based retrieval
- Distributed memory for large-scale applications

### Applications (`hd_compute.applications`)
- Speech command recognition (reproducing Qualcomm 2025 results)
- Cognitive computing examples
- Neuromorphic computing patterns

## Performance Considerations

- Binary hypervectors for memory efficiency
- Vectorized operations using native framework primitives
- Memory pooling to reduce allocation overhead
- Batch processing for maximum throughput

## Extension Points
