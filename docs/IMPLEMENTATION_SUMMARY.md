## Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub App permission limitations, the following actions must be performed manually by repository maintainers:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
Copy workflow files from `docs/workflows/templates/` and `docs/workflows/examples/` to `.github/workflows/`:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp docs/workflows/templates/*.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/workflows/examples/*.yml .github/workflows/
```

### 2. Repository Secrets Configuration
Configure the following secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - For package publishing
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For coverage reporting
- Additional secrets as documented in `docs/workflows/SETUP_REQUIRED.md`

### 3. Branch Protection Rules
Enable branch protection for the `main` branch with:
- Required status checks from CI workflows
- Required pull request reviews
- Administrator inclusion in restrictions

### 4. Repository Settings
- Enable GitHub Actions with appropriate permissions
- Configure issue and PR templates
- Set repository topics and description
- Enable security features (Dependabot, CodeQL scanning)
